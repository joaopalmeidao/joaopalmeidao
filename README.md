I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from University FUMEC and a postgraduate degree in Data Science from UNI-BH, both in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.

My career has equipped me with extensive skills in Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and programming. I am proficient in using a wide range of Python libraries such as Pandas, Django, Selenium, datetime, os, numpy, BS4, regex, boto3, logging, smtplib, imaptools, pyodbc, pymysql, pdfplumber, and more. Additionally, I have a fundamental understanding of JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, allowing me to contribute to both front-end and back-end development.

Passionate about leveraging data science for innovative solutions, I am always keen to enhance my knowledge and collaborate on exciting projects. Let's connect and explore opportunities together.
